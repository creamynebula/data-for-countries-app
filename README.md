# data-for-countries-app
App that lists all countries available from the API restcountries.eu and provide a search functionality. The search will filter countries from the list (case-insensitive), rendering results as you type, provided that the results are less than 10 countries. If it's more than 10, you will be informed to narrow down your search. If its between 10 and 1 result, the result will be presented as a list of these countries. If your query finally matches just 1 result, detailed info about this country will be shown, including live weather data pulled from another API - weatherstack.com &lt;b>Note: for this last functionality to work, you will need your own api key from api.weatherstack.com, you need to put it's value inside the environment variable process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY. You can do this by installing the node package 'dotenv', creating a .env file and setting the content inside of it to be REACT_APP_API_KEY='your key goes here'&lt;/b>
